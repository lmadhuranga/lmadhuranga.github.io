# 👋 Hi, I’m Maduranga Senadheera

**Senior Full-Stack Developer**  
React • Next.js • Node.js • NestJS • MongoDB

Welcome to my technical blog 👨‍💻  
I share **real-world engineering lessons**, **production insights**, and **interview-ready knowledge** from **10+ years** in software development.

No fluff. Just practical software engineering.

## ✍️  What I Write About

I write about building and scaling real-world web applications with React, Next.js, Node.js, and NestJS, covering performance, architecture, databases, system design, interview preparation, and the mindset required to grow as a senior engineer.


## 🧠  My Thoughts

- Code is easy to write — **decisions are hard**.
- Frameworks change, **fundamentals don’t**.
- Clean code matters, but **clear thinking matters more**.
- Production teaches lessons no tutorial can.
- Seniority is about **trade-offs, not tools**.
