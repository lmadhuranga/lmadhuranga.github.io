# 👋 Hi, I’m Maduranga Senadheera

**Senior Full-Stack Developer | React • Next.js • Node.js • NestJS • MongoDB**

Welcome to my technical blog — a place where I share **real-world engineering knowledge**, **production lessons**, and **interview-ready insights** from over **10 years in software development**.

I write about building scalable web applications, modern JavaScript architecture, and what actually matters when shipping software to production.

## 🔥 Why I’m Writing This

After years of interviews, production bugs, late-night deployments, and mentoring developers, I realized one thing:

> **Most learning resources don’t reflect real production challenges.**

This blog is my attempt to:

* Share **what actually works**
* Explain **why decisions matter**
* Help developers **level up faster**

No fluff. No copy-paste tutorials. Just **clear thinking and practical engineering**.
